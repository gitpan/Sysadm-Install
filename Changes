Revision history for Sysadm::Install
########################################

0.27 2008/03/26
    (ms) Fixes a broken CPAN upload.

0.26 2008/03/25
    (ms) Added rc/stdout/stderr debug output to tap()
    (ms) Added perm_get/set to export list
    (ms) Added shell escapes for tap()

0.25 2008/02/07
    (ms) Fixed directory stack bug in cdback()

0.24 2007/10/24
    (ms) Added def_or() function to emulate the //= operator
    (ms) Added blurt_atomic() to write data to a file, guaranteeing that
         the operation either fully succeeds or fails. It makes sure that
         we're not left with a partially written file in case the
         operation gets interrupted.
    (ms) fixed password_read() documentation bug

0.23 2007/04/01
    (ms) Added nice_time() and password_read().
    (ms) Fixed quote($str, ":shell") to escape single quotes within
         single quotes in a shell-compatible way.

0.22 2006/09/19
    (ms) Skipping Archive::Tar tests if A:T isn't installed

0.21 2006/02/02
    (ms) Added log messages to cp, mv, download, make.
    (ms) untar() and untar_in() now pass the cwd value to
         Archive::Tar's extract function to avoid excessive
         and expensive cwd() calls (thanks to Greg Olszewski
         for finding this performance bottleneck).

0.20 2005/08/13
    (ms) Requiring Log4perl-1.00 now to avoid a problem with the
         test suite.

0.19 2005/07/28
    (ms) Greg Olszewski reported a bug in untar_in() with tarfiles
         on relative paths, fixed by using one-argument version of
         rel2abs.

0.18 2005/07/14
    (ms) Requiring File::Temp 0.16 now (S:I needs OO-API).
    (ms) Errors are now reported via croak(), which reports the location
         in the calling script, not in Sysadm::Install.

0.17 2005/04/23
    (ms) Added interactive mode. If you call
         Sysadm::Install::confirm(1) before running Sysadm::Install
         commands, every writing function (cp(), mv(), untar(), pie(),
         blurt(), ...) will ask the user for confirmation before actually
         performing what's been requested. Sysadm::Install::confirm(0)
         switches back to normal.
    (ms) Added patch by Jud Dagnall to allow slurp() to process
         @ARGV like <> does.
    (ms) Archive::Tar is no longer mandatory for installation, just
         for using untar() and untar_in().

0.16 2005/04/10
    (ms) Bumped up Log4perl reporting level. On typical S:I functions,
         the log message will show the *calling program*'s file name
         and line number.
    (ms) slurp() and blurp() are now displaying parts of the data 
         read/written.
    (ms) Added check for IO::Zlib and better error message if it's
         not installed and a compressed tarball needs to be processed.
    (ms) Requiring L4p 0.48 and Archive::Tar 1.23 to make sure test
         suite succeeds.

0.15 (03/17/2005)
    (ms) Added eg/one-liner

0.14 (03/10/2005)
    (ms) Added dry-run function dry_run(1) suppressing write actions
    (ms) Added perm_get and perm_set to compliment perm_cp

0.13 (01/25/2005)
    (ms) Makefile.PL prerequisite changed from undef to '0'.

0.12 (01/15/2005)
    (ms) Added fs_read_open(), fs_write_open() and pipe_copy()
    (ms) blurt/slurp now report the # of bytes

    (ms) tap() single-quotes args now by default
    (ms) tap() allows for optional double-quoting or no-quoting

    (ms) removed Expect dependency ('require' on demand)
    (ms) added say()
    (ms) added sudo_me() and bin_find()
    (ms) tap() now returns the exit code as a third parameter. Improved
         command handling by using qquote() to separate args.

    (ms) corrected shell escapes with qquote()

    (ms) added plough

0.05 (10/16/2004)
